# NotHorror.exe
A game created by 4 humans. Features minor to no horror elements.
# The Idea
The principle of NotHorror.exe is a simple side scrolling "2.5D" game. Basically a 3D game, just as a 2D sidescroller. It will have a infinitely generating world, high scores, animations and other stuff. It's being created because we have to for collage.
